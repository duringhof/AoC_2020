# Advent of Code 2020

This repository contains my solutions to the 2020 edition of Advent of Code (or AoC). While I did not participate in the AoC in 2020, I used the assignments to prepare myself for the 2021 edition.

## Instructions to build the project

1. Clone the project repository: `git clone https://github.com/duringhof/AoC_2020.git`

3. Build the project: `make build`

4. Run the resulting executable: `./build/day1` (or choose another day of you want of coarse)
